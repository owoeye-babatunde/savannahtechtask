- This is my solution to the Suridata backend exercise by savannahTech

- The goal of this exercise is to simulate the Dwarf-Giant" Game

- It contains three files
    - main.py
    - run.py
    - testcase.py

        - main.py contains the main program, where all the functions necessary
          to solve the problem are written.
          
        - run.py is the easiest way to run the program and confirm the output. Both the
          test employee and the whole employee dataset sent to me are used as inputs.
        - on the commandline, make sure you are in the same directory 
             as the run.py file. Hit "python run.py"
             - Hurray! All constraints are satisfied!!

        - To confirm that the program passes all the test, test cases have been
          written to ensure that the program satisfy all the constraints. 
        - To confirm this, please make sure that you are in the same directory as
          the testcase.py file. And hit "python testcase.py" on the commandline.
            - Hurray! All test cases are passed!!
